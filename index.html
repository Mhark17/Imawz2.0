            The Imawz Squad is a group of friends formed during our college days — better known as Reme, N-Jay, Marvin, Jeralyn, El-Jhon, Glorymie, Roda, Junrel, Princess, Chariza, Ralf, and of course, me, their Class President. It started as a group of nine and eventually grew into twelve members who became more like a family than just classmates.
            College life — the time when we were supposed to “find ourselves,” but most of the time, we only found stress, caffeine, and endless deadlines. When I first entered college, I was full of dreams and nervous excitement — dreaming of success but secretly terrified of our professors. I can still remember those first few days: new faces, new friends, and new worries, pretending to look confident while secretly Googling “What is APA format?”

            Then came my second year, and that’s when everything changed — that’s when The Imawz Squad was born. Our friendship wasn’t planned; it just happened between late-night group works, last-minute submissions, and spontaneous food trips. We laughed, we stressed, and sometimes we questioned why we even chose this course. But through sleepless nights, endless projects, and even heartbreaks, we became each other’s support system.

Ah, the Capstone days — those were unforgettable. Sleepless nights, countless revisions, and small breakdowns became part of our routine. We would meet early, leave late, and still argue over formatting. Google Docs became our second home, and coffee became our best friend. Yet despite everything, The Imawz Squad stayed strong. We encouraged each other, teased each other, and sometimes just sat in silence asking, “Can we still do this?” Somehow, we did — we defended, we survived, and we made it to the finish line.

Sometimes, I still find myself looking back, realizing how fast time flew. It feels like just yesterday we were rushing to class, nervous about recitations, and now, it’s all over. So many things happened — the laughter, the tears, the times we almost gave up, and the moments we helped each other rise again. When I look back on my college journey, I don’t just see the sleepless nights or the stress — I see the friends who stood by me through it all. The Imawz Squad wasn’t just a group of classmates; they were the family I found in college.

Looking back brings so many good memories — the simple meals after exams, the late-night talks filled with jokes, and those long nights fighting sleep just to finish our Capstone project. After every exam or defense, we celebrated like there was no tomorrow — with food, laughter, and spontaneous trips that made every challenge worth it.

Then came the day we had all been waiting for — Graduation Day. Seeing everyone in togas, smiling through tears, felt like a dream come true. We looked at each other and said, “From sleepless nights to this moment — we did it, together.” It wasn’t just a diploma we earned, but the lessons, laughter, and memories that we’ll carry for life.

To every student out there, remember this: it’s okay to feel tired, it’s okay to cry, and yes — it’s definitely okay to eat before studying. Because in the end, success isn’t just measured by grades, but by how much you’ve grown and who stood beside you through every challenge.

This is our story — the story of The Imawz Squad. And now I can truly say, every sleepless night, every laugh, and every struggle was all worth it. Forever, The Imawz Squad. 💙
